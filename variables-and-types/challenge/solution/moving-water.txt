Moving Water - Rumi

When  you do things from your soul, you feel a river
moving in you, a joy.

When actions come from another section, the feeling
disappears.  Don't let

others lead you.  They may be blind or, worse, vultures.
Reach for the rope

of God.  And what is that?  Putting aside self-will.
Because of willfulness

people sit in jail, the trapped bird's wings are tied,
fish sizzle in the skillet.

The anger of police is willfulness.  You've seen a magistrate
inflict visible punishment.  Now

see the invisible.  If you could leave your selfishness, you
would see how you've

been torturing your soul.  We are born and live inside black water in a well.

How could we know what an open field of sunlight is? Don't
insist on going where

you think you want to go.  Ask the way to the spring.  Your
living pieces will form

a harmony.  There is a moving palace that floats in the air
with balconies and clear

water flowing through, infinity everywhere, yet contained
under a single tent.
